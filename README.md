# pjballon
Test platform made in Java for sending and receiving data (protected with hamming error-correction code) over a serial interface. Used for validating a new end-to-end radio transmission chain for a stratospheric ballon described in the final report.

FSK Modulator and demodulator schemas available (1200 and 4800 bauds).

Complete documentation available (in french). 

Done as part of the "Projet Ballon" in 2009.
