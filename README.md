# pjballon
Test platform made with Java for sending and receiving error-protected data (hamming code) over a serial interface. Used for validating the end-to-end radio transmission chain of a stratospheric ballon (mainly sending GPS coordinates and temperature/humidity data).

Complete documentation available (in french). 

Done as part of the "Projet Ballon" in 2009.
