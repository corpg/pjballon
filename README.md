# pjballon
Test platform to send and receive error-protected data (hamming code) over a serial interface (Java). Used for validating the end-to-end radio transmission chain of a stratospheric ballon (mainly sending GPS coordinates and temperature/humidity data).

Complete documentation available. 

Done as part of the "Projet Ballon" in 2009.
